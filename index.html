  <p>Currently studying <strong>HTML, CSS, & JS</strong></p>
  <p>This is my <strong>1st</strong> attempt to code via html</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>I currently work as a local residental plumber in Katy,tx. Due to my childhood intrest in programming I thought it would be great to finally take leap and pursue it. Iv'e read alot of stories online from people who were in the same boat as I
    am. After reading several threads,I decided to study coding online. I went ahead and learn HTML and I have to say I wish I had started this 15 years ago. The very thought of creating a website by coding HTML amazes me. You can imagine the joy
    and the jumping around when I publish my 1st site via GitHub. Heh although it was created while going alone with the instructional video, but hey at least i didnt have to go through a paid service site to create your own site.</p>
  <h2>Goals</h2>
  <p>Learn as much as I can in the front end aspect in programming.<br>Apply on what I learned in order for my skills to be utilized for future employment.</p>
